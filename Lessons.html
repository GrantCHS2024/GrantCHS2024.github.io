    <div class="text">
        <h1 class="section">Event Listeners</h1>
        <h1 id="text">Just like jQuery's '.on()' event function... '.addEventListener()' does the same without jQuery! <br>
            Check out this button: <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button> <br><br>
            I used document.addEventListener("click", () => {}) to make it work! <br>
            The first part is the event type, in this case "click". <br>
            The second part is an arrow function, which is a shorter way to write a function. <br>
            Inside the arrow function is what happens when the event is triggered. <br>
            Take a look at this function: <br>
            </h1>
            <h1 class="code">
                document.addEventListener("keydown", (event) => {  <br>
    if(event.key === "c"){  <br>
        alert("Boo! Did I scare you? You pressed the c key"); <br>
    } <br>
}); <br>
            </h1>
            <h1 id="text">
            That's right! It listens for if a key is pressed down, then the 'event' helps it check if the key is "c"! <br>
            If it is, then it alerts you! <br> <br>
            </h1>
            <h1 class="section">Player Movement</h1>
            <h1 id="text">
            How can we use this to create player movement? <br>
            With the help of "keyup" events too, we can make this box move around with W, A, S, and D smoothly! <br>
            </h1>
            <div class="box"></div>
            <h1 id="text">
                Lets take a look at the code for this little guy... Details will be written beside the code. <br>
            </h1> <br>
            <div class="code_One"><img src="Lesson_Code_1.jpg"></img></div>
            <h1 class="section">Canvas</h1>
            <h1 id="text">
                Canvas provides a blank area on a web page where graphics can be drawn dynamically using JavaScript. <br>
                To access it, you use 'canvas' tags. You can give it a class or id and bring it to JavaScript. <br>
                But by doing that, to access the drawing features, you'll need to establish it's context. <br>
                You can do this by naming a new variable and setting it to '(canvas variable name).getContext(2d)' <br>
                Now you can use that new variable to DRAW inside of that rectangle. <br>
                Here's a quick example of a little drawing app, just click the mouse around the box below.
            </h1>
            <canvas class="drawingCanvas" style="background: grey;" width="500" height="400"></canvas>
            <h1 id="text">
                Now, here's how that works... Again, Details will be written beside the code.
            </h1>
            <div class="code_Two"><img src="Lesson_Code_2.jpg"></div>
            <h1 id="text">
                The 'event' in the parameter is a special object passed to an event handler function when an event occurs. <br>
                For this one, it mainly tracks the mouse's position and sets the x and y values to its variables. <br>
                <br>
                Another thing you can add for making games inside canvas is 'ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)' at the VERY top of your draw function. <br>
                What this does is wipes the canvas so it can create a new frame instead of leaving the previous frame on screen. <br>
                Using that you can add a separate function that updates all values you have and calls the draw function(s) so they'll be drawn accordingly... Then, you can create cool games on your own! <br>
                If you want exmaples, check out "Floodwater Escape"'s code, and even "Double Down", which may be a work in progress at the time. Double Down also needs controllers, so check it out, and maybe the messy code...
